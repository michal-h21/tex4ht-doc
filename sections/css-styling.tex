\section{Document Styling Using CSS}
\label{sec:css-styling}

\texfourht\ provides several commands that can be used for changing of the
document appearance using Cascading Style Sheets (\css). Only basic styling for
the document is provided by default. Additional styles are added by configurations for the
fonts, packages and commands used in the document. Full control of the document
styling can be achieved using following commands and configurations.


\cmd{Css}\marg{content}

This command sends its content to the CSS file of the document. 

\DocConfigure{AddCss} {CSS file name}\EndDoc

Add local CSS file.

\begin{texsource}
\Css{body{max-width:70ch;margin: 1rem auto;}}
\Configure{AddCss}{custom.css}
% link to a CSS on some web:
\Configure{@HEAD}{\HCode{<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/style.css" />}}
\end{texsource}

\texcommand{\CssFile[list-of-css-files]content\EndCssFile}

The CSS file \texfourht\ used by default initially consists just
a single line,  \texcommand{/* css.sty */}. This line is later
replaced with the code submitted by the \texcommand{\Css{...}} commands.

The \texcommand{\CssFile} command allows to specify an alternative to the initial CSS file.
The alternative file consists of the code loaded from listed files, and of the
content explicitly specified in its body.

\begin{texsource}
\ConfigureList{mylist} 
{\HCode{<div class="mylist">}} {\HCode{</div>}} {* }{} 
       
\begin{document} 
       
\CssFile 
/* css.sty */ 
.mylist { color : red; } 
\EndCssFile 
\end{texsource}

The names in the list of files should be separated by commas, and the rectangular brackets are optional when the list is empty.

The file should include a line having the content of \verb|/* css.sty */|. If
more than one such line is included, the content of the \texcommand{\Css{...}} commands
replace the first occurrence of this line. Arbitrary many space characters may
appear around the substrings ‘/*’ and ‘*/’.
