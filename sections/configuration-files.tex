\subsection{Configuration file management}

It is possible to reuse common \texfourht\ configurations used in several
configuration files.  They can be inserted in a custom LaTeX package, but there
is one important thing to be aware of. The configuration hooks are inserted to
the patched commands when the compilation reaches the  
\texcommand{\begin{document}} command, so configurations for these hooks
declared before the hook definition have no effect. It is necessary to include
them in the \texcommand{\AtBeginDocument} command.

Sample package, \file{commonconfigurations.sty}:

\begin{texsource}
\ProvidesPackage{commonconfigurations}
\AtBeginDocument{%
\Configure{@HEAD}{\HCode{<meta name="test" content="test"/>\Hnewline}}
}
\endinput
\end{texsource}

It can be requested in a configuration file using \texcommand{\RequirePackage} command.

\begin{texsource}
\Preamble{xhtml}
\RequirePackage{commonconfigurations}
\begin{document}
\EndPreamble
\end{texsource}
